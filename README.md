# Tiny Pixel Planets
Main branch is version v0.6.1

Tiny Pixel Planets is a free open source space exploration game. Build, explore, and conquer the pixel galaxy.

Tiny Pixel Planets is made with Godot 4.3 as of v0.5.1
(Godot 4.4 broke Tiny Pixel Planets when I ported it, so I am waiting for Godot 4.5)
