## Title Update 2 (Current Version on main, not stable)
Since I decided to open a new public repository instead of opening my private repository to the public, the Earliest this repo goes back to is TU2 Beta 1.

### TU2 Beta 1

TU2 adds some major visual and gameplay overhauls. Features include:
- Planets in the sky now have 3D shading on them to correctly reperesent how the star light interacts with the star system (Using actual 3D scenes being layered onto sprites via viewports and shader magic)
- Added Slorgs! What is a block base sandbox game without a slime like enemy!
- Made world sizes for small and medium planets 4 time larger with new world generation system (Even takes less time to generate bigger worlds than the previous world gen system)
- Made armor that you can craft and wear! (No effects as of now, other than looking cool!)
- Added Silver and Copper ore, ingots, and pickaxes

- Fixed All worlds within a star system having the same generation
- Saves now save the world rotation and planetary orbits

### TU2 Beta 2
- Fixed Slorgs freezing and doing nothing after attacking
- Fixed inventory disappearing randomly
